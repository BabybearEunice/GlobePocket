# GlobePocket

## Inspiration We are not satisfied with the current traditional tourism arrangements and aim to create a new tourism ecosystem  

## What it does We use a chatbot to simulate the process of discussion between passengers and tour guides, increase the experience of passengers in the process of arranging the itinerary, and reduce the process of exploring and collecting information on the journey.  

## How we built it We started with our expertise in data science and systems, and combined global meteorological data and expert experience into system calculations, combined with meteorological knowledge to complete the tourism situation assessment. Then use natural language technology to realize thematic analysis to assist passengers in exploring suitable related projects.   

## Challenges we ran into The biggest difficulty in implementation is the acquisition of various aspects of data, including basic geographic, meteorological, astronomical, and other professional information, as well as reports and images related to attractions that can expand touristsâ€™ interests. Therefore, in order to enhance the overall experience of use, In the future system development, we will also invest more effort in data mining.  Actually we want to build a BERT model to classify posts of ins and Facebookâ€¦. But finally, we couldn't get pretty source dataðŸ˜“    

## Accomplishments that we're proud  Increase tourists' understanding of the current climate conditions of scenic spots, and explore scenic spots that are most in line with the current state of time and space for visitors.  

## What we learned Many problems have occurred in the acquisition of data and the integration of various services, such as the cooperation experience of API traffic restrictions and security regulations, etc., which makes our team more relevant in the industry cooperation method  ## What's next for GlobePocket In the next step, the team will focus on service stability and more comprehensive services as the development direction, and grow and develop as a "travel pocket assistant" as the goal
